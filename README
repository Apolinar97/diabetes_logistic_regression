Purpose: A simple webserver that allows users to query 
a logistic regression model for diabetes predictions.
Used the UCI Diabetes Data Set for training the model.

The server response a response of either 0 or 1.
	
	0 = negative diabetes
	1 = positive diabetes

Note: To be used in a bash environment

Getting started:

	Start the server with "./server.sh"

The application has two client APIs: post and get.

On a second terminal each client API can be called by:
	
	"./post.sh" to call the POST method
	"./get.sh" to prompt user input and calls the GET method
